This Insert(.unshift) function runs faster at first, but as the array becomes bigger, the runtime of the Insert(.unshift) fucntion increases exponentionally. Looking at the Append(.push) however, though it starts off with a longer runtime, it increases at a slower rate, indicating it scales better.
